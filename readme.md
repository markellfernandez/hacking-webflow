# Hacking Webflow

Tools and utilities for Webflow dev. Stuffs I did once and don't want to do again. Kinda rough, always WIP.

All cloneables and more stuffs can gbe found here [Cloneables](https://webflow.com/@vallafederico)

## Stuffs Index

| REFERENCE              | CURRENT VERSION | DOCS, HOW TO & CONFIG                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Stagger Text Animation | v 003           | [Currrent Docs](/src/staggerText/readme.md)  |
| Smooth Scroll          | WIP             | [Currrent Docs](/src/smoothScroll/readme.md) |

Please be aware that I don't insure backwards compatibility or really don't insure anything at all. If a script is running it should keep doing that, but might not be in the same place in the future. When shipping in production please please please download the bundled script from the dist folder and host it yourself, either by making it into a .txt and hosting on webflow or placing it somewhere you control.
